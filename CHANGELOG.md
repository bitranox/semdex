# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file following
the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format.


## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **`email.smtp_hosts` and `email.recipients` set to nothing mean not configured.** A bare YAML
  key or an environment `null` was refused as "Input should be a valid list" for both settings.
  Both now read `None` as an empty list.

### Security
- An email attachment allow or block list given in a form it cannot be read in is now refused instead of silently ignored. A comma-separated value (`.pdf,.txt` in an environment variable or `.env`) arrives as one string, and the validators turned any value that was not a list into "not configured", so btx_lib_mail's default lists applied in place of the configured ones. A list or tuple is read as its items (an empty one still means not configured), a set is kept as given, an empty value means not configured, and anything else fails validation naming the setting and the accepted form (a JSON array such as `[".pdf", ".txt"]`). `smtp_hosts` and `recipients` no longer turn a tuple or another non-list value into an empty list. The shipped `50-mail.toml` and `.env.example` documented the comma form for all six list settings; they now show the JSON-array and per-index forms.

### Changed
- **BREAKING (behaviour, not API): `ann_recall = "balanced"` no longer means "lancedb's driver default".** It now resolves to `nprobes=10, refine_factor=5` for lancedb only; pgvector and mariadb are untouched. A recall/latency sweep (`scripts/score_ann_frontier.py`) measured lancedb's own default keeping just 0.567 of the exact top-10 and giving up 0.0474 nDCG@10, which was the entire "approximation costs up to 5.6 percent" figure this project published. The new setting measures 0.986 recall and nDCG 0.8412 - 0.4 percent under an exact scan - for about 9 percent more search latency. Set `ann_recall = "fast"` to get the previous behaviour back. Only affects lancedb deployments that resolve ANN params through config.
- Every MCP tool schema now carries one-line, plain-text descriptions. Pydantic had copied each output model's developer docstring, and the `StoreBackend` / `Partition` enums' multi-paragraph docstrings, into the published `outputSchema` (RST markup and deployment advice included). Each model and enum field now states its own wire description; the enum fields still publish their allowed values. Validation is unchanged.

### Added
- `semdex serve`: an MCP server (a delivery-surface adapter, sibling of the CLI) exposing the search and reindex use cases over stdio (local) and Streamable HTTP (network). Tools: `list_datasets`, `search`, `reindex` (`reindex` refused for a `read_only` dataset). Install with the new `semdex[mcp-server]` extra (`fastmcp`).
- `[mcp]` config section (transport / host / port / auth) with a fully documented `defaultconfig.d/17-mcp.toml`. Auth modes: `none`, `bearer`, `oauth`; every secret loads from an environment variable named in config, never inline. OAuth proxy mode (the interactive-flow fields set) requires `[mcp].oauth_base_url`; without it the server now refuses to start with a clear `ConfigurationError` instead of failing later inside fastmcp. `[mcp].oauth_revocation_url` forwards an upstream token-revocation endpoint to the proxy when set.
- An unexpected exception raised inside an MCP tool (a bug, not a deliberately raised error) is masked from clients by default: `[mcp].mask_error_details` (default `true`) reaches FastMCP's own masking, so only a message we chose to send - never internal text or a traceback - ever crosses the wire. Set it `false` to see the original message while developing.
- Every MCP tool now returns its typed Pydantic model (`DatasetInfo`, `SearchHit`, `FusedSearchHit`, `ReindexResult`, `RememberResult`, `ForgetResult`) instead of an untyped dict, so FastMCP publishes a real `outputSchema` per tool rather than an open `{"type": "object"}` bag.
- `build_dataset_services` in composition: wires one dataset's store / embedding / connector / extractor / chunker, reusing the CLI index factories, from a `[[dataset]]` binding.
- ADR 0002 recording the MCP-server-as-adapter, secrets-from-env, and fastmcp-vs-mcp-client stances; `docs/COMPONENT_SETUP.md` gains an "MCP server (serve)" section.
- Fan-out search: `search_datasets(query, k, datasets)` MCP tool searches one, several, or all datasets (omit or pass `["all"]`) and fuses the per-dataset rankings by Reciprocal Rank Fusion (`[mcp].rrf_k`, default 60), embedding the query once per distinct model and never comparing raw cross-model similarity scores. Adds the `search_across_datasets` use case, `reciprocal_rank_fusion`, `FusedHit`, and `DatasetServices.model_key`.
- Writable knowledge datasets: a `[[dataset]]` with `writable = true` (no `sources`, not `read_only`) is a database-backed store an MCP client writes to via the new `remember(dataset, text, title, entry_id)` and `forget(dataset, entry_id)` tools; content is keyed by `semdex://<dataset>/<id>`, `reindex` refuses writable datasets, and `list_datasets` reports `writable`. Source-mirrored datasets stay read-only over their sources. Adds the `remember` / `forget` use cases (reuse `index_sources`).

## [1.5.4] 2026-06-14

### Changed
- Added a `typed_click.py` facade wrapping rich-click's `option` / `version_option` decorators behind explicit, fully-known signatures, keeping the CLI strict-clean under pyright 1.1.410 (`reportUnknownMemberType`) without disabling the rule (ignore isolated to the facade).
- Bumped internal dependency floors: `lib_cli_exit_tools>=2.3.2`, `lib_log_rich>=6.3.5`, `lib_layered_config>=5.5.2`, `btx_lib_mail>=1.3.2`.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-03-05 [YANKED]

### Changed
- `get_permission_defaults()` now returns a `PermissionDefaults` Pydantic model instead of a raw dict, with typed field access and `dir_mode_for()`/`file_mode_for()` methods
- `EmailSpy` now stores captured calls as `CapturedEmail` and `CapturedNotification` frozen dataclasses instead of `list[dict[str, Any]]`

### Added
- Tests for `--env-file` CLI option (argument passing, validation, end-to-end integration)

- Makefile `dev` target now correctly installs dev extras (`uv pip install -e ".[dev]"`)

### Changed
- CLAUDE.md: updated project structure trees to reflect actual codebase (added `entry.py`, `domain/errors.py`, `adapters/memory/`, `adapters/config/permissions.py`, `adapters/email/validation.py`; removed deleted `traceback.py`)
- CLAUDE.md: rewrote Make targets table to match new `bmk`-based Makefile (added aliases, new targets; removed obsolete `menu`, `test-slow`)

- **Configurable permission defaults** in `[lib_layered_config.default_permissions]` (app/host: 755/644, user: 700/600)
- **Octal string support** in config files (`"0o755"`, `"755"`, or decimal `493`)

### Changed
- `deploy_configuration()` accepts `set_permissions`, `dir_mode`, `file_mode` parameters
- CONFIG.md: comprehensive CLI options reference, `sudo -u` deployment examples

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-01

### Changed
- **Profile validation** now delegates to `lib_layered_config.validate_profile_name()` with comprehensive security checks:
  - Maximum length enforcement (64 characters)
  - Empty string rejection
  - Windows reserved name rejection (CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1-9, LPT1-9)
  - Leading character validation (must start with alphanumeric)
  - Path traversal prevention (/, \, ..)
- `validate_profile()` now accepts optional `max_length` parameter for customization

### Added
- `40-layered-config.toml` in `defaultconfig.d/` documenting lib_layered_config integration settings
- Profile validation tests for length limits, empty strings, Windows reserved names, and leading character rules
- Profile name requirements documentation in CONFIG.md and README.md

### Removed
- Custom `_PROFILE_PATTERN` regex - replaced by lib_layered_config's built-in validation

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-30

### Added
- **Attachment security settings** for email configuration (`[email.attachments]` section in `50-mail.toml`)
  - `allowed_extensions` / `blocked_extensions` - whitelist/blacklist file extensions
  - `allowed_directories` / `blocked_directories` - whitelist/blacklist attachment source directories
  - `max_size_bytes` - maximum attachment file size (default 25 MiB, 0 to disable)
  - `allow_symlinks` - whether symbolic links are permitted (default false)
  - `raise_on_security_violation` - raise or skip on violations (default true)
- New `EmailConfig` fields for attachment security with Pydantic validators
- `load_email_config_from_dict()` now flattens nested `[email.attachments]` section

### Changed
- Bumped `btx_lib_mail` dependency from `>=1.2.1` to `>=1.3.0` for attachment security features

## [1.1.2] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- Coverage SQLite "database is locked" errors on Python 3.14 free-threaded builds and network mounts (SMB/NFS)
- Removed bogus `COVERAGE_NO_SQL=1` environment variable from `scripts/test.py` (not a real coverage.py setting)
- CI workflow now sets `COVERAGE_FILE` to `runner.temp` so coverage always writes to local disk
- **Import-linter was a silent no-op** in `make test` / `make push` - `python -m importlinter.cli lint` silently exits 0 without checking; replaced with `lint-imports` (the working console entry point)
- CI/local parameter mismatches: ruff now targets `.` (not hardcoded `src tests notebooks`), pytest uses `python -m pytest` with `--cov=src/$PACKAGE_MODULE`, `--cov-fail-under=90`, and `-vv` matching local runs
- `scripts/test.py` bandit source path now reads `src-path` from `[tool.scripts.test]` instead of hardcoding `Path("src")`
- `scripts/test.py` module-level `_default_env` now rebuilt with configured `src_path` before running checks
- `run_slow_tests()` now reads pytest verbosity from `[tool.scripts.test].pytest-verbosity` instead of hardcoding `"-vv"`

### Changed
- **pyproject.toml as single source of truth**: CI workflow extracts all tool configuration (src-path, pytest-verbosity, coverage-report-file, fail_under, bandit skips) from `pyproject.toml` via metadata step - workflow is portable across projects without editing
- `scripts/test.py` removed module-level `PACKAGE_SRC` constant; bandit source path computed from `config.src_path` inside the functions that need it
- `make push` now accepts an unquoted message as trailing words (e.g. `make push fix typo in readme`); commit message format is `<version> - <message>`, defaulting to `<version> - chores` when no message is given
- Removed interactive commit-message prompt from `push.py` - message is either provided via CLI args / `COMMIT_MESSAGE` env var, or defaults to `"chores"`

### Added
- `pytest_configure` hook in `tests/conftest.py` that redirects coverage data to `tempfile.gettempdir()` and purges stale SQLite journal files before each run

## [1.1.1] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- CLAUDE.md: replaced stale package name `bitranox_template_cli_app_config_log_mail` with `semdex` throughout
- Brittle SMTP mock assertions in `test_cli.py` now use structured `call_args` attributes instead of `str()` coercion
- Stale docstring in `__init__conf__.py` claiming "adapters/platform layer" - corrected to "Package-level metadata module"
- Weak OR assertion in `test_cli.py` for SMTP host display - replaced with two independent assertions
- Removed stale `# type: ignore[reportUnknownVariableType]` from `sender.py` (`btx_lib_mail.ConfMail` now has proper type annotations)
- Late function-body imports in `adapters/cli/commands/config.py` moved to module-level for consistency

### Removed
- Dead code: unused `_format_value()` and `_format_source()` wrappers in `adapters/config/display.py`

### Added
- `__all__` to `__init__conf__.py` listing all public symbols
- `tests/test_enums.py` with parametrized tests for `OutputFormat` and `DeployTarget`
- Expanded `tests/test_behaviors.py` with return type, constant value, and constant-usage checks
- Python 3.14 classifier in `pyproject.toml`
- Codecov upload step in CI workflow (gated to `ubuntu-latest` + `3.13`)
- Edge-case tests for `parse_override`: bare `=value`, bare `=`, and CLI `--set ""` empty string
- Duplication-tracking comments for CI metadata extraction scripts

### Changed
- `tests/test_display.py` rewritten to test `_format_raw_value` and `_format_source_line` directly (replacing dead wrapper tests)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-27

### Changed
- Replaced `MockConfig` in-memory adapter with real `Config` objects in all tests (`config_factory` / `inject_config` fixtures)
- Replaced `MagicMock` Config objects in CLI email tests with real `Config` instances
- Unified test names to BDD-style `test_when_<condition>_<behavior>` pattern in `test_cli.py`
- Email integration tests now load configuration via `lib_layered_config` instead of dedicated `TEST_SMTP_SERVER` / `TEST_EMAIL_ADDRESS` environment variables

### Added
- Cache effectiveness tests for `get_config()` and `get_default_config_path()` LRU caches (`tests/test_cache_effectiveness.py`)
- Callable Protocol definitions in `application/ports.py` for all adapter functions, with static conformance assertions and `tests/test_ports.py`
- `ExitCode` IntEnum (`adapters/cli/exit_codes.py`) with POSIX-conventional exit codes for all CLI error paths
- `logdemo` and `config-generate-examples` CLI commands
- `--set SECTION.KEY=VALUE` repeatable CLI option for runtime configuration overrides (`adapters.config.overrides` module)
- Unit tests for config overrides and display module (sensitive key matching, redaction, nested rendering)

### Removed
- Dead code: `raise_intentional_failure()`, `noop_main()`, `cli_main()`, duplicate `cli_session` orchestration, catch-log-reraise in `send_email()`
- Replaced dead `ConfigPort`/`EmailPort` protocol classes with callable Protocol definitions

### Fixed
- POSIX-conventional exit codes across all CLI error paths (replacing hardcoded `SystemExit(1)`)
- Sensitive value redaction: word-boundary matching to avoid false positives, nested dict/list redaction, TOML sub-section rendering
- Email validation: reject bogus addresses (`@`, `user@`, `@domain`); IPv6 SMTP host support; credential construction
- Profile name validation against path traversal
- Security: list-based subprocess calls in scripts, sensitive env-var redaction in test output, stale CVE exclusion cleanup
- Documentation: wrong project name references, truncated CLI command names, stale import paths, wrong layer descriptions
- CI: `actions/download-artifact` version mismatch, stale `codecov.yml` ignore patterns
- Unified `__main__.py` and `adapters/cli/main.py` error handling via delegation

### Changed
- Precompile all regex patterns in `scripts/` as module-level constants for consistent compilation
- **LIBRARIES**: Replace custom redaction/validation with `lib_layered_config` redaction API and `btx_lib_mail` validators; bump both libraries
- **LIBRARIES**: Replace stdlib `json` with `orjson`; replace `urllib` with `httpx` in scripts
- **ARCHITECTURE**: Purified domain layer - `emit_greeting()` renamed to `build_greeting()` (returns `str`, no I/O); decoupled `display.py` from Click
- **DATA ARCHITECTURE**: Consolidated `EmailConfig` into single Pydantic `BaseModel` (eliminated dataclass conversion chain)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-15

- Slow integration test infrastructure (`make test-slow`, `@pytest.mark.slow` marker)
- `pydantic>=2.0.0` dependency for boundary validation
- `CLIContext` dataclass replacing untyped `ctx.obj` dict
- Pydantic models: `EmailSectionModel`, `LoggingConfigModel`
- `application/ports.py` with Protocol definitions; `composition/__init__.py` wiring layer

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Full Clean Architecture refactoring into explicit layer directories (`domain/`, `application/`, `adapters/`, `composition/`)
- CLI restructured from monolithic `cli.py` into focused `cli/` package with single-responsibility modules
- Type hints modernized to Python 3.10+ style
- Removed backward compatibility re-exports; tests import from canonical module paths
- `import-linter` contracts enforce layer dependency direction
- `make test` excludes slow tests by default
